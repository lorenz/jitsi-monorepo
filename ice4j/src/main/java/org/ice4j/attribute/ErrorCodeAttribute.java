/**
 * The ERROR-CODE attribute is present in the Binding Error Response and
 * Shared Secret Error Response.  It is a numeric value in the range of
 * 100 to 699 plus a textual reason phrase encoded in UTF-8, and is
 * consistent in its code assignments and semantics with SIP [10] and
 * HTTP [15].  The reason phrase is meant for user consumption, and can
 * be anything appropriate for the response code.  The lengths of the
 * reason phrases MUST be a multiple of 4 (measured in bytes).  This can
 * be accomplished by added spaces to the end of the text, if necessary.
 * Recommended reason phrases for the defined response codes are
 * presented below.
 *
 * To facilitate processing, the class of the error code (the hundreds
 * digit) is encoded separately from the rest of the code.
 *
 *   0                   1                   2                   3
 *   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
 *  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 *  |                   0                     |Class|     Number    |
 *  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 *  |      Reason Phrase (variable)                                ..
 *  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 *
 * The class represents the hundreds digit of the response code.  The
 * value MUST be between 1 and 6.  The number represents the response
 * code modulo 100, and its value MUST be between 0 and 99.
 *
 * The following response codes, along with their recommended reason
 * phrases (in brackets) are defined at this time:
 *
 * 400 (Bad Request): The request was malformed.  The client should not
 *      retry the request without modification from the previous
 *      attempt.
 *
 * 401 (Unauthorized): The Binding Request did not contain a MESSAGE-
 *      INTEGRITY attribute.
 *
 * 420 (Unknown Attribute): The server did not understand a mandatory
 *      attribute in the request.
 *
 * 430 (Stale Credentials): The Binding Request did contain a MESSAGE-
 *      INTEGRITY attribute, but it used a shared secret that has
 *      expired.  The client should obtain a new shared secret and try
 *      again.
 *
 * 431 (Integrity Check Failure): The Binding Request contained a
 *      MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute, but the HMAC failed verification.
 *      This could be a sign of a potential attack, or client
 *      implementation error.
 *
 * 432 (Missing Username): The Binding Request contained a MESSAGE-
 *      INTEGRITY attribute, but not a USERNAME attribute.  Both must be
 *      present for integrity checks.
 *
 * 433 (Use TLS): The Shared Secret request has to be sent over TLS, but
 *      was not received over TLS.
 *
 * 500 (Server Error): The server has suffered a temporary error. The
 *      client should try again.
 *
 * 600 (Global Failure:) The server is refusing to fulfill the request.
 *      The client should not retry.
